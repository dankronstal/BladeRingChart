The pbiviz file in the dists folder can be downloaded and imported into a PowerBI dashboard to try out. The assets folder also contains the sample data set used for my example, and can be set up to appear as shown below:

*Each arc represents a weight-adjusted data value
*Each ring represents a categorization
*Each "blade" (selection of one arc per ring) represents a set/group
*Click on a Bar Chart item to select a Province in the sample data set, and the Blade/Ring Chart will respond by sorting the rings to present the selected Province blade HERE
